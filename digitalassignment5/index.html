<h2>kill bunnie v2</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
This is a mouse spam game combined with a dodge the homing bullet game. It also incorporates a smokescreen to make visibility low.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
This uses custom animations and a interesting difficulty scaling system, based on score. 
After iterative improvements it also has:
start screen,
object attraction (bunnies -> player),
and an interesting grass mechanic.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
Learned how to use a tilesheet png to create animation. Also learned a bit of how to scale difficulty.
The most difficult part was getting the difficulty scaling right. learned how to make objects attracted to other objects.
also learned how to apply different scenes to make a start screen etc.

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
    Help the park ranger keep the explosive bunny population down.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
National park service ranger 
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Input: mouse and keyboard (arrow keys)
Randomness: very random (in terms of bunny and hp pot spawning)
Genre: survival maybe
Playstyle: competitor
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?
maybe catchup because bunnies continously spawn. 
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
Have fun and be stressed..
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The player can move via arrow keys. To squish the bunnies, simply click on them. Hp pots spawn randomly based on score. 
The bunnies will spawn faster and faster as your score increases.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Move carefully, but there is a lot of rng so good luck. Grass clears where the player steps (but be careful you move slower thru it).
Bunnies are only attracted when you move, take that into account (though they are faster when not attracted).
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
In 2069, covid-69 has mutated and infected a breed of bunnies. These bunnies somehow have built up enough toxins to become dangerous to the touch. Your job as a national park ranger is 
to exterminate these vermin. "Why the national park service?" I don't know somehow he's the only one available for the job.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
This game is for everyone, mainly younger kids who want a challenge.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Depends on how long you can last. Maybe 3 min?
</li>
