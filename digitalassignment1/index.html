This game is designed to be played competitively. Players compete to get the highest score.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The player can run left and right, and jump/fall (via arrow keys). The platforms can be used to help dodge potions. 
Every 200 points, the player gets 1 extra life. When each wave of stars are collected, another potion spawns.

Being nimble with arrow key controls. Figuring out when to jump and when to stay still. A bit of luck may be needed.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
This game is set in imaginary space time continuum called "blank". For some reason the dude is stuck on some platforms and having potions chucked at him.
But this dude is greedy greedy greedy so he wants all the stars (which are a form of currency).
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Anyone who likes platformers or those (old) flash games.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Depends on how long the player can last. Maybe 3 minutes?
