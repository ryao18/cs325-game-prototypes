<h2>Drop piano??</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
A classic dropper game but with added functionality. The player can slow time and there are flying bunnies out to get you.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
    *incorporates a start screen
    *has particle effects thanks to RenderTexture
    *cool bound checker for player and platforms
    *cool platform spawning
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
Learned how to use RenderTexture and a bit more physics stuff. Also learned how to use different scenes to create a start screen.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
Closest example taken from here: https://www.emanueleferonato.com/2021/01/28/mix-and-merge-more-sprites-into-one-single-game-object-in-your-html5-games-thanks-to-phaser-rendertexture-game-object/

</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Drop down as many platforms as possible while dodging flying bunnies.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
The platform is holding a heavy piano. :)
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.
Input: indirect + keyboard
randomness: some because of bunny spawning
play style: collector and maybe competitor
genre: arcade I guess
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?
maybe catchup because bunnies continously spawn. 
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
</li>
Your goal is to drop on as many green platforms possible. Click to destroy the platform you're on. Destory flying bunnies by clicking on them.
You can also press down arrow key to slow yourself.
<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Abuse the time slow button well.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
    In 2069, covid-69 has mutated and infected a breed of bunnies. These bunnies somehow have built up enough toxins to become dangerous to the touch.
    They can also fly. You, a piano, must get to the ground safely. 
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
This game is for everyone, mainly younger kids who want a challenge.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
How long does your game take to play?
less than 1-2 min
</li>
