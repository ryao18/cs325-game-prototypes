<h2>Dice game!</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
What is original about your game?
This is a cool dice battle game where players fight with unique rules. 
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
What is interesting about your game technology?
It incorporates computer controlled players that the player must battle against. 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned how to directly make buttons trigger functions, and how to add computer players to a game.
The easiest part was creating my own sprites.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.

</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
This is a iteration based on my digital game 6. I have buffed the bots (comp1 and comp2) in that they always target either bots or player with highest score.
I have also added an attack animation for the player, along with attack and heal indicators for all bots and players.
<li> The knight animation code was borrowed from a phaser example.<a href="https://phaser.io/examples/v3/view/animation/on-complete-event>link">link</a></li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
Want players to feel lucky or unlucky. 
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
To begin playing, click the ROLL button. If the sum of your roll is 6,8,10,12,or 14  you can attack the other players (for 1/2 that sum). 
If the sum of your roll is less than 6 or greater than 15, then you can choose if you want to heal a player (or don't, just roll! :) ).
Otherwise, the sum just adds to your total score. First to 100 wins the game! 
note: The attack/heal buttons will appear automatically.
