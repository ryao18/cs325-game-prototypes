This is a cool dice battle game where players fight with unique rules.

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
To begin playing, click the ROLL button. If the sum of your roll is 6,8,10,12,or 14  you can attack the other players (for 1/2 that sum). 
If the sum of your roll is less than 6 or greater than 15, then you can choose if you want to heal a player (or don't, just roll! :) ).
Otherwise, the sum just adds to your total score. First to 100 wins the game! 
note: The attack/heal buttons will appear automatically.
