<h2>Kinda like curling but not V2</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
What is original about your game?
It is based on curling, but adds a twist of different obstacles and a changing target.

</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
What is interesting about your game technology?
New:
Using tweens to add moving obstacles that have set patterns and movements
These obstacles are able to push the curling ball.
Old:
The ball incorporates drag, which makes the game much more difficult and fun.
To allow the player to enter a power level, I've incorporated an html textbox.
It uses tweens to create a startup animation and animation on no user input. 
To calculate how close the ball is to the bulls-eye target, I've used Phaser's 
distance betweenPoints method. It calculates the distance between an invisible point on the bulls-eey
and the ball. The resulting score is calculated based on the distance.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
I learned how tweens works in Phaser. Also learned how to make different shaped collision boxes (circles in this case).
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
The easiest part was creating my own sprites. 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Didn't base off any digital game, but the concept is based on curling. 
the tweens movement was based on this example: https://codepen.io/samme/pen/wYLQOY
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Get the ball to the bulls-eye.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
n/a
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
input - direct via mouse and keyboard
randomness - some randomness (target position)
genre - competitor
play style - overhead
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
action points - the player is allowed to set power and shoot once per game
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
The player should feel strategic when determing optimal power levels and angles to shoot the ball.
They may also feel frustrated or annoyed if they come close but not on the target.

</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
To start, the power enters in a power level between 1 and 2000. This scales linearly.
Next, the player will aim with the mouse pointer, and press spacebar to shoot the ball.
After the ball stops moving, the score and distance are shown to the player.
To play again, the player will click restart.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Generally, a lower power level is easily to use (ex. 400). Larger power level increases the randomness a bit.
There may be some optimal places to shoot and bounce off of.
The moving obstacles have a pattern, you may use it to your advantage.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
n/a
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
 people who enjoy darts or curling will likely enjoy this kind of game.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
 less than 10 seconds.
</li>
